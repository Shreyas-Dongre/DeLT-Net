# DeLT-Net
An unique attempt to identify sponsor content segments in YouTube videos using AI models.

This repository contains 4 ipynb's <br>
[DeLT_Net_DistilBERT_Training.ipynb - Scripts to make dataset from subtitles and train DistilBert model.](https://github.com/Shreyas-Dongre/DeLT-Net/blob/main/DeLT_Net_DistilBERT_Training.ipynb); <br>
[DeLT_Net_LSTM_Training.ipynb - Scripts to make dataset from YouTube's interest graph and train Bi-Directional LSTM model.](https://github.com/Shreyas-Dongre/DeLT-Net/blob/main/DeLT_Net_LSTM_Training.ipynb); <br>
[DeLT_Net_DeiT_Training.ipynb - Scripts to make dataset from video frames (at 1fps) and train DeiT model.](https://github.com/Shreyas-Dongre/DeLT-Net/blob/main/DeLT_Net_DeiT_Training.ipynb)<br>(The ipynbs demonstrates end-to-end flow).

[DeLT_Net_DistilBERT_Training.ipynb - Final pipeline with weighted fused model, to test the concept.] (The ipynbs detailis the architecture and results.)

This research was completed in May 2023 by Shreyas Dongre and Shrushti Mehta.

## Running predictions
Run the Final Pipeline ipynb on any videos you want.
Details coming soon!


## Fetching the dataset
